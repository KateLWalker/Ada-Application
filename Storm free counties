# How many counties in the state of Washington that do not begin wit a vowel remained storm free in 2007?
Answer: 15 counties 

#Before answering this question, I had to remove all of the rows where the County/Parish, Zone or Marine name began with a vowel.  To do this I wrote a program in TextWrangler using Ruby and then printed in the terminal only the rows in which the CZ_NAME column did not begin with a vowel.   I did this with the following code:
require 'csv'
CSV.foreach(â€˜filename.csv', headers:true) do |row|
	if row['CZ_NAME'].start_with? ("A")
	elsif row['CZ_NAME'].start_with? ("E")	
	elsif row['CZ_NAME'].start_with? ("I")
	elsif row['CZ_NAME'].start_with? ("O")
	elsif row['CZ_NAME'].start_with? ("U")    
	else
	  puts row
  end
end
