##### _1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?_

	I have been interested in computers since I was a teenager. I have a few friends who work as  
	programmers and have always been interested in the field.  However, I struggled through my  
	first attempt at college without finding a career path that I was passionate about. I wanted  
	to do something practical, such as accounting, but could not keep myself interested. During  
	my time out of school I have tried a few different professions, but I find the thing I enjoy  
	doing the most is interacting with technology. Completing this application has lead me to  
	research some basic programming applications and have found it all to be very interesting.  
	I am excited to delve further into the field and discover what it has to offer.
	
##### _2. What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?_

	I am currently taking online classses to complete my bachelors in Management Information  
	Systems. If accepted into this program I would be taking a hiatus for these courses to  
	complete the certification your institution is offering. After receiving the certification  
	for programming I am planning on completing the final year of my bachelors degree and then  
	seeking employment in an information technology/management area of a business.  I believe  
	that understanding and being able to program will be incredibly valuable to my career in  
	the technology field. 
	
##### _3. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you leared a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?_

	Previously I was a Store Manager for a large coffee company in the area. I had invested 5  
	years in the company and in that time I had worked my way up from barista to store manager.  
	Unfortunately, when I reached the Store Manager level I had difficulty communicating with my  
	District Manager. He would push me to discipline or fire employees when I did not believe it  
	would be what was best for the store. In the end I allowed myself to be pushed out of the  
	company and give up what I had put in so much time training for. When I reflect back on the  
	experience now I would like to think that I would have more courage to stand up for what I  
	thought was right and work through the disagreements with the District Manager so we could  
	both be happy with the decisions being made.
	
##### _4. Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it._

	I am currently enrolled in an online Calculus course. Math has always been a difficult  
	subject for me and Calculus is the class I have struggled with the most. It had been 12  
	years since I had taken this type of math and I knew that I would basically be starting  
	from scratch. Since I realized that this would be difficult for me, I was able to start  
	the class prepared, having already set up a tutor and worked out a schedule for studying.  
	It has been very trying because there is not always someone there to answer my questions  
	and I have had to do a lot of research on my end to find where I am going wrong and how  
	to complete certain problems. Overall, I have learned that there are a lot of resources  
	out there to help you learn anything and have become more adept at utilizing them.
