##### _1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?_

	I have been interested in computers since I was a teenager. I have a few friends who work as  
	programmers and have always been interested in the field.  However, I struggled through my  
	first attempt at college without finding a career path that I was passionate about. I wanted  
	to do something practical, such as accounting, but could not keep myself interested. During  
	my time out of school I have tried a few different professions, but I find the thing I enjoy  
	doing the most is interacting with technology. As a first step towards understanding one of  
	the most commonly used programming languages, I am currently working through an introductory  
	tutorial to Java programming.  Also, at the end of October I will begin another online 
	course for Java, which will also cover HTML/CSS, through Duke University with the intention 
	of earning a Java certification.
	
##### _2. What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?_

	I am currently taking online classses to complete my bachelors degree in Management Information  
	Systems.  In the next 2 years I plan on completing my degree in MIS and will then 
	seek employment in an information technology/management area of business, where I could work
	towards becoming an Information Systems Manager or IT Project Manager.  I would like  
	to find a company where I would be able to learn and move into a management position where I  
	could utilize my leadership experience.  Within the next 5 years I see myself in a rewarding  
	career where I can use my education to to help advance me along the ranks in the technology sector.
	I believe that understanding and utilizing the ablility to program will be incredibly valuable to  
	my career in the technology field. 
	
##### _3. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you leared a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?_

	Previously I was a Store Manager for a large coffee company in the area. I had invested 5  
	years in the company and in that time I had worked my way up from barista to store manager.  
	Unfortunately, when I reached the Store Manager level I had difficulty communicating with my  
	District Manager. He would push me to discipline or fire employees when I did not believe it  
	would be what was best for the store. In the end I allowed myself to be pushed out of the  
	company and give up what I had put in so much time training for. When I reflect back on the  
	experience now I would like to think that I would have more courage to stand up for what I  
	thought was right and work through the disagreements with the District Manager so we could  
	both be happy with the decisions being made.
	
##### _4. Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it._

	I am currently enrolled in an online Calculus course. Math has always been a difficult  
	subject for me and Calculus is the class I have struggled with the most. It had been 12  
	years since I had taken this type of math and I knew that I would basically be starting  
	from scratch. Since I realized that this would be difficult for me, I was able to start  
	the class prepared, having already set up a tutor and worked out a schedule for studying.  
	It has been very trying because there is not always someone there to answer my questions  
	and I have had to do a lot of research on my end to find where I am going wrong and how  
	to complete certain problems. I am more than halfway through the course and am currently  
	maintaining a 89%.  Overall, I have learned that there are a lot of resources out there  
	to help you learn anything and have become more adept at utilizing them.
