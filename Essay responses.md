##### _1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?_

    	I have been interested in computers since I was a teenager. I have a few friends who work as  
    	programmers and have always been interested in the field.  However, I struggled through my   
	first attempt at college without finding a career path that I was passionate about. I wanted   
	to do something practical, such as accounting, but could not keep myself interested. During   
	my time out of school I have tried a few different professions, but I find the thing I enjoy   
	doing the most is interacting with technology. In my attempt to learn about programming, I 
	have worked through a Java tutorial as well as the Codecademy course for beginning Ruby and 
	the Jumpstart lessons offered by Ada. I have also installed Ruby and a text editor to continue 
	working with what I have learned.  It has been challenging and rewarding to work through these 
	courses and know that each day I am able to program new things.
	
##### _2. What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?_

	I am currently taking online classes to complete my bachelor’s degree in Management Information  
	Systems. In the next 2 years, I would like to continue pursuing my degree online while working 
	a full time position as a software developer.  I plan to use my bachelor’s degree, which offers 
	me experience in project management and IT, and combine it with my growing knowledge of various 
	programming languages to allow me the opportunity to work as a software developer.  In the next 
	5 years, I feel that I would have the field experience to fully realize my plan to lead an 
	innovative software development team in a growing organization. 
	
##### _3. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you leared a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?_

	Previously I was a Store Manager for a large coffee company in the area. I had invested 5  
	years in the company and in that time I had worked my way up from barista to store manager.  
	Unfortunately, when I reached the Store Manager level I had difficulty communicating with my  
	District Manager. He would push me to discipline or fire employees when I did not believe it  
	would be what was best for the store. In the end I allowed myself to be pushed out of the  
	company and give up what I had put in so much time training for. When I reflect back on the  
	experience now I would like to think that I would have more courage to stand up for what I  
	thought was right and work through the disagreements with the District Manager so we could  
	both be happy with the decisions being made.
	
##### _4. Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it._

	I am currently enrolled in an online Calculus course. Math has always been a difficult  
	subject for me and Calculus is the class I have struggled with the most. It had been 12  
	years since I had taken this type of math and I knew that I would basically be starting  
	from scratch. Since I realized that this would be difficult for me, I was able to start  
	the class prepared, having already set up a tutor and worked out a schedule for studying.  
	It has been very trying because there is not always someone there to answer my questions  
	and I have had to do a lot of research on my end to find where I am going wrong and how  
	to complete certain problems. I am more than halfway through the course and am currently  
	maintaining a 89%.  Overall, I have learned that there are a lot of resources out there  
	to help you learn anything and have become more adept at utilizing them.
